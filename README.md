Inspired by the start of the college basketball season and staunch support of my alma mater. mubbtweets is a tracker with search key of “mubb”, which filters and displays streaming tweets, as well as geo-locates them. 
*note - typically #mubb hashtag only really used around / during marquette basketball games :) like to follow along during the game
